    <h2>Hi! I'm junior web-developer and it's my test-widget app.</h2>
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <h3>I'll be honest - I took an already made widget as a basis, found it on the Internet, it seems that it was even made for your company. Where I work we make a widget, but there is pure TS + Webpack, I wanted to write the same, but your stack assumes Vue))</h3>
    <h3>p.s. Of course, it was necessary to add pictures to the widget and style it more...</h3>

    <div class="my_widget_container_position">
